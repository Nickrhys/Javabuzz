JAVABUZZ
========

Fizzbuzz, in Javascript, tested in Jasmine. The first Javascript program built from scratch. Fully tested in Jasmine. 

How to use
----------

Open SpecRunner.html in command line and, in the console (Google Chrome shortcut for console is cmd + option + i), intitialise an instance of Javabuzz(); at the prompt, as you did in your spec file:

```
var javabuzz = new Javabuzz();
```

Now you can give it a go. 

```
>  javabuzz.says(3)
<- "Java"

>  javabuzz.says(5)
<- "Buzz"

>  javabuzz.says(15)
<- "Javabuzz"

>  javabuzz.says(1)
