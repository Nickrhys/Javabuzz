JAVABUZZ
========

Fizzbuzz in Javascript, tested in Jasmine. My first programme, from scratch, in Javascript. If you want to play, go to your browser, and in the same window where your SpecRunner.html is loaded up, open your console (Google Chrome shortcut is cmd + option + i) and at the prompt intitialise an instance of Javabuzz:

```
var javabuzz = new Javabuzz();
```

Now you can test it out:

```
>  javabuzz.says(3)
<- "Java"

>  javabuzz.says(5)
<- "Buzz"

>  javabuzz.says(15)
<- "Javabuzz"

>  javabuzz.says(1)
<- 1
```
